# 🔐 Embedded Password Home Lock System (8051 + I²C)

## Overview
This project is a **microcontroller-based smart home lock system** built using two **8051 (AT89C51)** microcontrollers that communicate via the **I²C protocol**. It features secure password entry, real-time feedback through an LCD display, and relay control for locking mechanisms. Designed for embedded systems learners and hobbyists, the project integrates both hardware and software design principles.

## System Components

### Microcontrollers
- **AT89C51 (x2)**
  - **Master (Outside Unit)**: Handles user input and display.
  - **Slave (Inside Unit)**: Stores and verifies passwords, controls hardware.

### Communication
- **I²C Protocol** for reliable data transfer between master and slave.

### Peripherals
- **4x4 Keypad** – Password input
- **16x2 LCD** – Displays status messages
- **Relay/Motor Driver** – Controls the door lock
- **Buzzer** – Alerts for wrong password or breach
- **LEDs** – Visual indicators

---

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: User enters a 4-digit password via the keypad.
2. **Master Processing**: Master displays the password on the LCD and sends it via I²C to the slave.
3. **Password Verification**: Slave compares the password with the stored one.
4. **Access Decision**:
   - ✅ Correct password: Unlocks door, activates green LED.
   - ❌ Incorrect password: Triggers buzzer, activates red LED.
